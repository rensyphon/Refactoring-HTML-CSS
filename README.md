# REFACTORING-HTML-CSS

## Description

This project edited pre-written code for a professional, modern-looking business website, in order to make the HTML and CSS cleaner, more accessible, and better understood.

The goal is to have the code function as it originally did, while being easier to read and work on the future. This has been accomplished by using semantic HTML tags and commenting various CSS functions. Additionally, alt IDs have been added to embedded images, to better meet accessibility standards.
